# Data-Visualization-Tableau
Hands-on exercise for the Data Visualization and Analysis module with Tableau, for the "Mujeres en Tech" Bootcamp, KeepCoding &amp; Glovo. 

I created a Dashboard with three views, to show data on Airbnb rentals in the city of Madrid. 

- The first Map graph shows the avarage  final price (avarage price + avarage cleaning fee + avarage security deposit)  of rental properties, by zipcode of Madrid, and a bar graph in emergent description showing the number of reviews by property type. 

- The second bar graph shows the avarage final price by property type.

- The third map graph shows Hosts by neighborhood and zipper code in Madrid.
